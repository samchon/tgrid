/**
 * SharedWorker server.
 *
 *  - available only in the Web Browser.
 *
 * The `SharedWorkerServer` is a class representing a server in `SharedWorker`
 * environment. Clients connecting to the `SharedWorkerServer` would communicate
 * with this server through {@link SharedWorkerAcceptor} instances using RPC
 * (Remote Procedure Call) concept.
 *
 * To open the server, call the {@link open} method with your callback function
 * which would be called whenever a {@link SharedWorkerAcceptor} has been newly
 * created by a new client's connection.
 *
 * Also, when declaring this `SharedWorkerServer` type, you have to define three
 * generic arguments; `Header`, `Provider` and `Remote`. Those generic arguments
 * would be propagated to the {@link SharedWorkerAcceptor}, so that
 * {@link SharedWorkerAcceptor} would have the same generic arguments, too.
 *
 * For reference, the first `Header` type represents an initial data from the
 * remote client after the connection. I recommend utilize it as an activation tool
 * for security enhancement. The second generic argument `Provider` represents a
 * provider from server to client, and the other `Remote` means a provider from the
 * remote client to server.
 *
 * @template Header Type of header containing initialization data like activation.
 * @template Provider Type of features provided for the remote client.
 * @template Remote Type of features provided by remote client.
